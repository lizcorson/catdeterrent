# catdeterrent
This device will use a motion sensor to spray water at my cat to keep him out of places he's not supposed to be. Thanks to this video for the instructions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSz4FQPsir8 I've programmed it so that the LED lights up any time motion is detected, but the spray triggers at most once per ten seconds.

## Status

Everything is connected and working! Now I just need to build some way to rig it up with a bottle of water.
