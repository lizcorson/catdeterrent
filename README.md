This device will use a motion sensor to spray water at my cat to keep him out of places he's not supposed to be. Thanks to this video for the instructions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSz4FQPsir8

## Status

Just started! Right now it sends a message to the serial terminal and lights up an LED when motion is detected. The next step will be to break open the auto-trigger sprayer and hook it up.
